## Why This Guide Matters

Getting keel up and running is the first critical step toward transforming your process management experience. This page is crafted to provide clear, actionable instructions that save you time and prevent headaches, whether you’re installing from source or Pip. Knowing the dependencies and installation nuances empowers you to avoid common pitfalls and quickly start managing processes from a unified terminal interface.

## Installing keel

### Pip Installation — The Recommended Path

The simplest, fastest way to get keel running on your system is via Python’s package manager, Pip. This method handles dependencies automatically and ensures you stay up to date with the latest improvements.

### Steps to Install via Pip:

1. **Ensure Python 3 is installed.**
   - keel requires Python 3. Verify with:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Install keel using Pip:**

   ```bash
   pip install keel
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**

   While keel is not yet packaged as a standalone executable command, you can run the program directly using Python after installation.

   ```bash
   python3 -m keel.keel -h
   ```

   This command displays usage help and confirms the package is installed correctly.

<Tip>
The `-h` flag is your quick reference to see required parameters like username and mode.
</Tip>

### Installing from Source

If you prefer to work directly from the source repository or want the latest development version:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/modelorona/keel.git
   cd keel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   keel uses standard Python packages, primarily `psutil` and `curses` (ncurses bindings). Ensure you have these installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Note: The requirements.txt is referenced but verify its presence in the repo or install dependencies manually.)*

3. **Run the program:**

   ```bash
   python3 keel.py -u your_username -m regular
   ```

---

## Key Dependencies

keel operates on core Python 3 and depends on these essential components:

- **Python 3.6+**: Ensures compatibility with newer syntax and libraries.
- **psutil**: For fetching and controlling system processes and network connections.
- **ncurses (curses in Python)**: Provides the terminal UI framework for an interactive experience.

<Tip>
Most modern Linux distributions include `ncurses` by default. Windows users may require an alternative terminal or compatibility layer.
</Tip>

### Dependency Management

All dependencies are handled automatically when using Pip. When installing from source, ensure you have administrative rights or use virtual environments to manage Python packages safely.

## Running keel — Initial Setup Notes

Since keel is not yet exposed as a command-line executable, you must run it through Python directly using the main script with parameters.

### Required Parameters:

- `-u` or `--username`: Specifies the Linux user whose processes you want to view (defaults to `root` if omitted).
- `-m` or `--mode`: Must be either `regular` (for normal process listing) or `connections` (for network connections).

Example command:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u alice -m connections
```

<Tip>
Running `python3 keel.py -h` will display a help screen summarizing valid parameters and usage.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Installation and Runtime Issues">
<Accordion title="Python version errors">
Ensure you are running Python 3. keel is incompatible with Python 2.x. Verify your version with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you only have `python` pointing to Python 2, use `python3` explicitly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing dependencies">
If you encounter errors about missing modules like `psutil` or `curses`, try:

```bash
pip install psutil
``` 

For `curses`, note it is part of Python standard library on Unix/Linux. On Windows, consider using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or compatible terminals.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission denied errors">
Running keel requires permissions to view and kill processes by user. Make sure your user account has sufficient privileges or try running as `root` (or via `sudo`) if necessary.

Be cautious when running as root to avoid unintended system disruptions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI rendering issues">
Terminal UI relies on ncurses and compatible terminal emulators. If the interface does not display properly or breaks:

- Try resizing the terminal window.
- Use a modern terminal emulator like `xterm`, `gnome-terminal`, or `Windows Terminal` under WSL.
- Ensure your terminal supports color and cursor control sequences.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Future Installation Enhancements

The project is actively evolving. Planned improvements include:

- Packaging keel as a standalone, executable command line tool post-installation.
- A simplified installation script to handle all environment setup.
- Expanded documentation for containerized deployments or cross-platform builds.

Stay updated by visiting the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelorona/keel).

## Summary

By following this guide, you will have keel installed and ready to launch, integrated with required Python 3 dependencies and ncurses for the interactive terminal UI. Once installed, you can immediately begin managing processes and connections with a clear, unified interface that streamlines your workflow.

For seamless operation, ensure your system meets Python 3 and ncurses prerequisites, and choose the installation method that suits your environment best.

# Example: Running keel after installation

```bash
# Install keel
pip install keel

# Check command line help
python3 -m keel.keel -h

# Run keel for user alice, regular mode
python3 -m keel.keel -u alice -m regular
```

This will launch the terminal UI listing all processes owned by alice, enabling you to navigate and kill processes easily.

<Note>
Because keel is based on ncurses, ensure you run it in a supported terminal environment. Running inside incompatible shells or minimal consoles may cause display issues.
