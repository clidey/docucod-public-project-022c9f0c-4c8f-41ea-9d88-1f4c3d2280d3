# Quick Feature Overview

## Introducing keel's Core Capabilities

keel is designed to streamline your process and network connection management from a single terminal interface. This page offers a snapshot of the key features currently implemented and those planned, helping you understand what you can do with keel today and what enhancements are expected soon.

## Key Features and Functionalities

### 1. Process Listing and Filtering
- **User-Specific Process Display:** Quickly retrieve all active processes owned by a specified username, allowing targeted management without clutter.
- **Comprehensive System Process Views:** Optionally, view all processes running system-wide, supporting broader administrative oversight.
- **Name-Based Process Filtering:** Find processes matching a specific name substring to identify and manage related tasks efficiently.

### 2. Network Connection Monitoring
- **Open Connection Display:** View active system network connections filtered by various types such as TCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, UNIX sockets, and more.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Switch easily between connection kinds to isolate particular network activities relevant to your investigative or defensive tasks.

### 3. Kill Process via Keyboard Interaction
- **Intuitive Key-Driven Control:** Select any highlighted process or open connection and kill it immediately by pressing the Enter key, minimizing steps and improving response times.
- **Safety Checks:** Prevent accidental shutdown of the running keel process itself to avoid unintended self-termination.

### 4. Multiple Display Modes
- **Regular Mode:** Show processes owned by a specific user, ideal for focused management on particular user sessions.
- **Connections Mode:** Display open network connections, enabling combined process and connection management within one interface.
- **Planned Extensibility:** The foundation is in place to easily add more modes or filters for future expansions.

### 5. Terminal-Based User Interface
- **ncurses-Powered Interface:** Provides smooth, real-time navigation in the terminal with intuitive key commands.
- **Highlight & Navigate:** Arrow keys let you browse lists with clear highlight indicators showing the currently selected item.
- **In-Session Mode/Profile Changes (Planned):** Upcoming features include on-the-fly switching of user and mode within the interface for greater flexibility.

## Practical Examples

- **Cleaning Up User Processes:** As an admin, you can start keel with a user filter to see only that user's processes, identify runaway or suspicious tasks, and kill them with a single keystroke.
- **Monitoring Network Connections:** Quickly switch to connections mode to identify and close suspicious TCP connections during a security incident.
- **Combined Workflow:** By integrating process and connection views in one UI, teams can drastically reduce the time spent context-switching during cyber defense operations.

## What’s Planned and Coming Soon

- **On-Demand User and Mode Switching:** Users will be able to change the context directly inside the UI, avoiding restarts.
- **Expanded Connection and Process Filtering:** More granular filters and advanced search capabilities.
- **Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback:** Better messages and recovery options when killing processes or switching modes.
- **Extended Logging and Audit Trails:** Improved visibility on user actions for compliance and troubleshooting.

## Technical Glossary

- **PID:** Process Identifier, a unique number assigned to each running process.
- **Mode:** Defines which data set is viewed - e.g., user processes or network connections.
- **Open Connections:** Active network sockets established on the system.
- **ncurses:** A programming library for building terminal user interfaces.

## Getting Started with These Features

To explore these features, start keel from the command line specifying a username and mode using:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u <username> -m <mode>
```

- Replace `<username>` with the system username you want to filter by.
- Choose `<mode>` as either `regular` (process listing) or `connections` (network monitoring).

From there, use arrow keys to navigate the list and press `Enter` to kill the highlighted process or close the selected connection.
