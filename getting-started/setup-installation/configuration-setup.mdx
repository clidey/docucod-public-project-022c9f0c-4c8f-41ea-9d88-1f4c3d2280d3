# Configuration & Initial Setup

Welcome to the initial configuration and setup guide for **keel**. This page will walk you through how to configure keel for its first use — from invoking the main program with the required parameters to understanding the modes and options available that enable a successful runtime experience.

---

## 1. Understanding Key Setup Parameters

Keel depends on a simple but essential command-line interface that requires two parameters every time you run the program:

- `-u` or `--username`: Specify the username whose processes or connections you want to manage. If this is omitted or invalid, `root` will be used by default, but using a real user account ensures expected behavior.

- `-m` or `--mode`: Choose the mode in which keel operates. There are two modes:
  - `regular`: Lists system processes owned by the specified user
  - `connections`: Shows open network connections

Example:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u alice -m regular
```

This starts keel displaying processes owned by user 'alice' in regular mode.

### Why these parameters are important

*Username filtering* enables focused visibility and control, preventing noise from unrelated users’ processes. *Mode selection* lets you toggle between monitoring traditional system processes and active network connections — two critical aspects of system defense.

## 2. Invoking keel with Required Parameters

Follow these steps to correctly start keel:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open your terminal">
Start your preferred terminal application. Ensure you have Python 3 installed and accessible.
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to the keel installation folder or confirm keel is installed via pip">

- If installed through pip, you can run keel from anywhere by referencing the installation directory or calling the script directly.
- If running from source, navigate to the folder containing `keel.py`.

</Step>
<Step title="Run keel with flags">
Execute the command with both `-u` (username) and `-m` (mode) flags. For example:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u root -m connections
```

This will start keel showing all network connections for the root user.

</Step>
<Step title="Access usage help">
If you’re unsure about the parameters or want to check valid usage, run:

```bash
python3 keel.py -h
```

This displays the help text with all arguments and descriptions.

</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Omitting either required flag will cause keel to refuse to run, signaling a missing argument error.
</Note>

## 3. Understanding Modes and Username Behavior

### Modes Explained

- **regular mode** — Displays all system processes owned by the specified user.
- **connections mode** — Shows all open network connections (TCP, UDP, etc.) for the specified user.

Keel defaults to regular mode if `regular` is explicitly provided. The mode influences what list you see and can act upon.

### Username Handling

- The username passed to `-u` must exist on your system; keel attempts to filter processes/connections accordingly.
- If you specify a username that does not exist or omit the username, keel will default to `root`.
- Using a real username helps you target the exact set of processes or connections you want to manage.

<Tip>
When testing keel, try `root` for full system access or your own username to avoid permission issues.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Example Invocation and Expected Behavior

Run keel as follows:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u modelorona -m regular
```

- This opens the terminal UI, listing all system processes owned by 'modelorona'.
- Use the arrow keys to navigate the list.
- Press `Enter` to kill the selected process.
- Press `q` to quit the program.

If you run:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u root -m connections
```

- You will see active open connections associated with the root user.
- You can select and close connections similarly, improving your control over network traffic.

<Check>
The title bar always shows your current user and mode, confirming your setup.
</Check>

---

## 5. Viewing Usage Help and Valid Options

To review the program’s invocation options at any time:

```bash
python3 keel.py -h
```

This command displays:

- The required `-u` / `--username` argument and its description
- The required `-m` / `--mode` argument and allowed values (`connections`, `regular`)

Example output snippet:

```
usage: keel.py [-h] -u USERNAME -m {connections,regular}

Kill processes easily.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        specify a specific username or root will be used by default. problems if user is not real
  -m {connections,regular}, --mode {connections,regular}
                        select the mode to start out with. default is regular
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Error: missing required argument: -u/--username or -m/--mode">
Ensure you provide both arguments exactly when running keel. Running without the required flags will generate an error.

Example:

```bash
python3 keel.py -m regular
```

will fail because `-u` is missing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Processes or connections not displaying">
- Verify the username is valid on your system.
- Confirm you have the necessary permissions to view processes/connections.
- For some users, permissions may restrict viewing system-wide details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Program closes immediately or shows empty screen">
- Ensure you specified a valid mode.
- If no processes or connections exist for the given user and mode, the UI will immediately exit.
- Try using `root` or another real user.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keel cannot kill certain processes">
- Some processes are protected or owned by other users/privileges.
- The include of process ownership filtering helps avoid permission errors.
- Killing system processes may require root privileges.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Run keel with elevated permissions (`sudo`) if you need full access, but only do so cautiously.
</Tip>

## 7. Next Steps After Configuration

Once you've successfully configured keel and run your first session:

- Explore the interactive terminal UI features such as process selection and killing.
- Learn how to switch between modes during use (planned feature).
- Review the [First Successful Run](../first-run-validation/first-successful-run) documentation to confirm your environment.
- Check [Troubleshooting Common Issues](../first-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you encounter problems.

## Summary
This page centered on configuring keel by correctly invoking it with the necessary parameters: username (`-u`) and mode (`-m`). Users learned how to start keel, the importance of these parameters, examples of usage, how to interpret the program's usage help, and key troubleshooting points for a smooth setup experience.

Start keel confidently knowing exactly what each option does and how to get the terminal UI displaying your target process or connection lists.

### Code snippet summary from keel.py (main execution flow):

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Kill processes easily.')

parser.add_argument('-u', '--username', type=str, required=True, help='specify a specific username or root will be used by default. problems if user is not real')
parser.add_argument('-m', '--mode', type=str, choices=['connections', 'regular'], required=True, help='select the mode to start out with. default is regular')

args = parser.parse_args()

username = args.username
mode = args.mode

ui = TerminalUI()
ui.setup(username, mode)
start(ui)
```

This clearly shows the required parameters and the UI setup that follows.
