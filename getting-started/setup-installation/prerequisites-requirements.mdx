# Prerequisites & System Requirements

Ensuring your system is compatible and properly prepared before installing and running **keel** is crucial for a smooth experience. This page outlines the essential Python versions, system capabilities, and third-party dependencies required to get started with keel effectively.

---

## 1. Supported Python Versions

- keel is written entirely in **Python 3**.
- **Python 3.6 or higher** is required for proper functionality.
- To verify your Python version, run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If your Python version is less than 3.6, upgrade your Python installation before proceeding.

---

## 2. System Capabilities

### Operating System
- keel is designed for use on UNIX-like systems (Linux, BSD, macOS) where Python 3 and **ncurses** support are available.
- The utility runs in a terminal and relies on the **ncurses** library for its interactive text interface.
- Windows is **not officially supported** due to differences in terminal handling and ncurses availability.

### Terminal Requirements
- A compatible terminal emulator that supports ncurses-based applications is mandatory.
- Recommended terminal emulators include `xterm`, `gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, or macOS Terminal.

### Resource Requirements
- keel is lightweight, requiring minimal CPU and memory.
- Ensure your system has:
  - At least **100MB of free RAM** to run comfortably alongside other operations.
  - Sufficient terminal window size (recommended minimum 80 columns by 24 rows) for clear display.

---

## 3. Dependencies & Third-Party Packages

keel depends on several Python libraries to manage processes and render its interface:

- **psutil**: Essential for process and network connection management.
- **ncurses**: Utilized via Python’s `curses` module for terminal UI.

### Installing Dependencies
- When installing keel via PIP, dependencies in `requirements.txt` are automatically installed.
- Alternatively, install required packages manually with:

```bash
pip3 install psutil
```

- The ncurses library is typically bundled with the Python standard library (`curses` module), but confirm your Python environment supports it.

### Verify Dependencies
Run the following Python script to test if all dependencies are met:

```python
import psutil
import curses

print('psutil version:', psutil.__version__)
try:
    stdscr = curses.initscr()
    curses.endwin()
    print('ncurses (curses) available')
except Exception as e:
    print('ncurses (curses) not available:', e)
```

If this script runs without errors, your environment is set up correctly.

## 4. Access and Permissions

- keel requires permission to query and manage system processes.
- Running keel with a specific user (via the `-u` argument) restricts process visibility and management to that user’s processes.
- To manage system-wide processes or those owned by other users:
  - Run keel as the **root** user or with appropriate elevated permissions.

> **Tip:** If you encounter permission errors, consider running keel with `sudo` or adjust user privileges accordingly.

---

## 5. Network & Environment Settings

- keel can operate in two modes: **regular system processes** and **network connections**.
- No special firewall or network ports need to be opened for keel operation, as it interacts locally with the OS.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- Ensure Python 3 and pip are properly installed and linked to your command line.
- Avoid using Python 2 or environments without curses support.
- If running inside limited or containerized environments, verify terminal emulation and device file permissions.

## Next Steps

After confirming your system meets these prerequisites:

1. Proceed to the [Installation Methods](/getting-started/setup-installation/installation-methods) page to install keel.
2. Follow [Configuration & Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup-installation/configuration-setup) to prepare keel for your environment.
3. Review [First Successful Run](/getting-started/first-run-validation/first-successful-run) to execute your first operation.
