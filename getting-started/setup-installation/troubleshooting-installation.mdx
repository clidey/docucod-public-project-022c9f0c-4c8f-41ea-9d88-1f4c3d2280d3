# Troubleshooting Installation Issues

This guide helps you quickly identify and resolve common installation problems with **keel**, ensuring a smooth start to your process and connection management experience.

---

## 1. Common Installation Problems

### 1.1 Missing Dependencies

- **Problem**: When running `keel`, you get errors related to missing Python packages (e.g., `psutil`, `curses`).

- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (version 3.6 or higher is required).
  2. Install keel’s dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  3. If you installed keel using pip, it installs `psutil` automatically, but verify it with:

    ```bash
    pip show psutil
    ```

  4. To check if ncurses support is present (required for the terminal UI), try:

    ```python
    python3 -c "import curses"
    ```
    If this raises an import error, you need to install curses or your OS equivalent:

    - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`
    - **MacOS:** ncurses is included by default.

<Tip>
If you installed Python via a minimal environment (e.g., some Docker containers), curses may be missing. Make sure to include development headers for ncurses.
</Tip>

### 1.2 Python Version Mismatch

- **Problem**: Errors or failure to run `keel.py` with syntax or import errors.

- **Solution**:
  1. Check your Python version by running:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

  2. keel requires **Python 3.6+**.
  3. If you're using an older version, upgrade your Python environment.

### 1.3 Permission Issues

- **Problem**: Some processes or network connections do not appear, or the program can't kill processes.

- **Solution**:
  1. For normal users, `keel` shows only processes owned by that user.
  2. To view or manage system or other users’ processes, run keel as root or with elevated privileges:

    ```bash
    sudo python3 keel.py -u root -m regular
    ```
  3. Always be cautious running as root to avoid unintended system changes.

<Warning>
Running keel with root privileges gives broad access to system processes. Only do so if you fully understand the implications.
</Warning>

### 1.4 pip Installation Failures

- **Problem**: Running `pip install keel` fails.

- **Solution**:
  1. Verify that pip targets Python 3 (`pip3 install keel` on some systems).
  2. Upgrade pip to the latest version:

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

  3. Check your internet connection and proxy settings if behind a firewall.
  4. If issues persist, consider installing inside a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv keel-env
    source keel-env/bin/activate
    pip install keel
    ```

### 1.5 Incomplete or Corrupted Installation

- **Problem**: keel commands do not respond or crash unexpectedly.

- **Solution**:
  1. Reinstall keel to ensure all files are intact:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall keel
    pip install keel
    ```

  2. If manually running `keel.py`, pull the latest code from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/modelorona/keel.git
    cd keel
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  3. Run keel directly:

    ```bash
    python3 keel.py -u yourusername -m regular
    ```

## 2. Validating Your Installation

Follow these steps to confirm keel is installed and working correctly.

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Python Version">
Run:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Confirm that the output is Python 3.6 or higher.
</Step>
<Step title="Check Dependencies">
Run:

```bash
pip show psutil
python3 -c "import curses"
```

Both commands should succeed without error.
</Step>
<Step title="Run keel Help">
Execute:

```bash
python3 keel.py -h
```

You should see usage instructions listing the required `-u` (username) and `-m` (mode) parameters.
</Step>
<Step title="Run keel in Regular Mode">
Run:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u yourusername -m regular
```

If the terminal UI launches listing your processes, the installation works correctly.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Replace `yourusername` with your actual system username or `root` for full system access.
</Tip>

## 3. Additional Troubleshooting Tips

### 3.1 Terminal UI Not Displaying Correctly

- Try running in a different terminal emulator.
- Ensure your terminal supports curses (most Linux terminals, macOS Terminal, and Windows WSL).
- Windows native command prompt does not support curses by default. Use WSL, Git Bash, or install Windows Terminal.

### 3.2 Errors About Killing Processes

- Some processes cannot be killed if you lack permission or if the process is critical.
- Logs are written to `output.log` in the current directory. Check this file for error details.

### 3.3 Unexpected Exit or Application Crash

- Verify no conflicting Python packages or environment issues.
- Run keel in verbose mode by increasing logging level (modify `keel.py` logging level to `DEBUG`) to get more information.

## 4. Where to Get Help

- Visit the [keel GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/modelorona/keel/issues) for known problems and community help.
- Consult the surrounding documentation:
  - [System Requirements & Prerequisites](/getting-started/setup-installation/system-requirements)
  - [Installing keel](/getting-started/setup-installation/installing-keel)
  - [Running keel for the First Time](/getting-started/first-steps/running-keel)
  - [Troubleshooting Startup & Usage](/getting-started/first-steps/common-setup-issues)

<Tip>
Keeping your system updated and Python environment clean significantly reduces installation hurdles.
</Tip>
