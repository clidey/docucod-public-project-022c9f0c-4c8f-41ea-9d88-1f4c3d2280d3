# Installation Methods

This guide walks you through straightforward steps to install **keel**, a terminal-based Python 3 utility for managing and killing system processes interactively. Whether you use pip or prefer manual execution, these instructions ensure you set up keel correctly across different platforms.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing keel, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python 3.6 or later** must be installed and accessible via the command line as `python3` or `python`.
- **pip** (Python package manager) should be available for Python 3.
- Your terminal must support **ncurses** (standard for most Unix/Linux/macOS terminals).

<Tip>
If you are unsure about your Python or pip versions, run:
```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```
On Windows, ensure Python and pip are added to your PATH.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing keel via pip (Recommended)

Installing keel through pip is the easiest and most platform-agnostic method.

### Step-by-step instructions:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install keel
   ```
3. Wait for pip to download and install keel and its dependencies (like `psutil`, `ncurses` compatibility).

### Verification:

After installation, verify keel is installed by running:
```bash
pip show keel
```
This command should display package information including the version.

<Tip>
If you encounter permissions issues, try:
```bash
pip install --user keel
```
or run the install command with elevated permissions (e.g., `sudo` on Linux/Mac).
</Tip>

## 3. Running keel

Currently, keel is not provided as a global executable command. You run it via Python, providing mandatory parameters:

- `-u` or `--username`: Specify the user whose processes you want to manage (defaults to `root` if omitted, but recommended to specify explicitly).
- `-m` or `--mode`: Select mode, either `regular` for processes or `connections` for network connections.

### Example:

```bash
python3 -m keel.keel -u root -m regular
```

Alternatively, if installed globally, you can run the main python file directly:

```bash
python3 path/to/keel.py -u your_username -m regular
```

<Tip>
Run `python3 keel.py -h` to see all available command-line options and help.
</Tip>

## 4. Manual Installation (Alternative)

If pip installation is not preferable, install keel manually from source:

### Steps:

1. Clone or download the [keel GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelorona/keel).
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelorona/keel.git
cd keel
```
2. Install dependencies manually:
   ```bash
pip install psutil
# ncurses support is typically provided by the system
```
3. Run keel using Python directly:
   ```bash
python3 keel.py -u your_username -m regular
```

<Tip>
This method gives you flexibility to explore or modify the source.
</Tip>

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Tips

- **Python Version:** keel requires Python 3.x; Python 2.x is not supported.
- **User Argument:** Specifying the correct username with `-u` is critical â€” incorrect usernames can lead to empty process lists.
- **Permissions:** Killing certain processes requires elevated privileges; consider running with `sudo` or as a user with sufficient rights.
- **Environment Path:** Especially on Windows, ensure Python and scripts are on your PATH to avoid execution issues.

## 6. Next Steps

After installing keel and verifying functionality, proceed to:

- Configure keel for personalized setups ([Configuration & Initial Setup](/getting-started/setup-installation/configuration-setup))
- Run your first session and validate operation ([First Successful Run](/getting-started/first-run-validation/first-successful-run))
- Troubleshoot common installation or usage issues ([Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues))
