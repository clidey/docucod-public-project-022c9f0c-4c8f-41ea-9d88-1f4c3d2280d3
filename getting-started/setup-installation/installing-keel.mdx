# Installing keel

This guide walks you through installing **keel** using Python's package manager **pip**. You'll learn how to install keel either globally or within a virtual environment, ensuring flexibility based on your preferences and system setup.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing keel, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x must be installed (3.6 or higher recommended).
- **Operating System**: Compatible with most Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). Windows users may need additional setup for `ncurses` compatibility.
- **Dependencies**:
  - The `psutil` library for process management (automatically installed with keel).
  - `ncurses` support for terminal UI (commonly pre-installed on Unix systems).

<Tip>
Verify your Python version by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```
Install pip if missing:

```bash
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

### Option A: Installing Globally

This installs keel for all users on your system.

<Steps>
<Step title="Run pip install">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install keel
```

This downloads and installs keel version 0.1 and its dependencies.
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Installation">
After installation, confirm keel is installed:

```bash
pip show keel
```

You should see package details including version and author.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Global installation may require administrative permissions. Use `sudo` if permission denied:

```bash
sudo pip install keel
```
Ensure you understand permission implications for your system security.
</Warning>

### Option B: Installing Inside a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps keel isolated from other Python packages.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a virtual environment">

```bash
python3 -m venv keel-env
```

This creates a directory `keel-env` with isolated Python.
</Step>
<Step title="Activate the environment">

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source keel-env/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:

```bash
keel-env\Scripts\activate
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install keel">

Now install keel inside the activated environment:

```bash
pip install keel
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify installation">
Run:

```bash
pip list | grep keel
```

You should see `keel` listed with the installed version.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts with other Python projects and to maintain system cleanliness.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Best Practices and Recommendations

- Prefer virtual environments, especially if working on multiple Python projects.
- Regularly update keel and dependencies:

```bash
pip install --upgrade keel
```
- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` inside your virtual environment to track dependencies for reproducible setups.

<Check>
Keep your Python and pip tools up to date to avoid compatibility issues.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```
</Check>

---

## 4. Post-Installation Verification

After installing:

1. Confirm installation by checking keelâ€™s presence:

```bash
pip show keel
```

Ensure it reports the expected version and metadata.

2. Test keel functionality by running the help command:

```bash
python3 -m keel.keel -h
```

You should see the usage details for keel, including parameters `-u` (username) and `-m` (mode).

<Tip>
Since keel is not yet fully packaged as a standalone executable, you will launch it via Python using the `keel.py` module.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
If you encounter permission errors during global install, try:

```bash
sudo pip install keel
```

Or install inside a virtual environment to avoid system-wide permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="pip Not Found or Outdated">
Ensure pip is installed and updated:

```bash
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip install --upgrade pip
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Dependencies or Compilation Errors">
Check if your system has development tools installed (`build-essential` on Linux, Xcode tools on macOS).

Dependencies like `psutil` may require compilation. Installing these tools resolves errors.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Running keel Shows Module Not Found">
Make sure you run keel with Python 3 and the package installed in the correct environment.

Activate your virtual environment if using one.
</Accordion>
