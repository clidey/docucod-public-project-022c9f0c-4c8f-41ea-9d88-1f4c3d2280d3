# System Requirements & Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth and effective experience running **keel**, it is essential to prepare your system with the correct platform, Python version, and dependencies. This guide outlines all required environments and pre-flight checks you need before installing and running keel for process and network connection management.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

- **Operating Systems**: keel is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems where Python 3 and ncurses support are available.
  - Recommended: Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, etc.)
  - MacOS (with Python 3 installed)
  - Not currently supported on Windows due to dependency on ncurses for the terminal user interface.


<Tip>
Ensure your OS terminal supports curses-based applications to avoid display issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Python Version Requirements

- keel requires **Python 3** to operate.
- It has been tested and verified on Python 3.6 and above.

### Verifying Python Version

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Expected output example:

```
Python 3.8.10
```

If the output shows Python 2.x or no Python, install Python 3 accordingly before proceeding.


## 3. Required Python Libraries

keel relies on several essential Python libraries to interact with system processes and provide its terminal UI.

| Library     | Purpose                               | Installation Command            |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `psutil`    | Access system process and network info | pip install psutil             |
| `ncurses`   | Terminal UI rendering (via Python curses module) | Included in Python standard library on supported systems |


The key dependency is **psutil**, which provides the interface to interact with processes and network connections relevant to keel’s core functionality.


## 4. Validating ncurses Support

- The program uses the Python **curses** library, which is a wrapper around **ncurses**.

- To confirm that your environment supports ncurses, test Python’s curses module:

```bash
python3 -c "import curses; print('curses module available')"
```

If no error appears and the message prints, your system supports ncurses.


<Warning>
Absence of the ncurses support will result in keel not being able to launch its terminal interface.
</Warning>

## 5. User Permissions and Access

- keel requires permission to read system process information.
- For accessing or managing processes owned by other users (especially root processes), you must run keel with appropriate privileges—for example, using `sudo`.


<Note>
Running keel with root privileges allows full visibility into system processes and network connections but exercise caution with elevated permissions.
</Note>

## 6. Summary Checklist Before Installation

- [ ] Linux or macOS system with terminal emulator supporting ncurses
- [ ] Python 3.6 or later installed
- [ ] `psutil` installed via pip (`pip install psutil`)
- [ ] Confirm curses module is available
- [ ] User access or sudo rights as needed

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Environment Issues">

<Accordion title="Python 3 Not Found or Incorrect Version">

- **Problem:** Running `python3 --version` returns Python 2.x or command not found.
- **Solution:** Install Python 3 via your package manager (e.g., `apt install python3` on Debian/Ubuntu or `brew install python` on macOS).
- Confirm by running `python3 --version` again.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="psutil Installation Fails">

- **Problem:** `pip install psutil` raises errors.
- **Solution:** 
  - Ensure you have Python development headers and build tools installed:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3-dev build-essential`
    - On Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-devel gcc`
  - Try reinstalling psutil.
  - Consider using a virtual environment for dependency isolation.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="curses Module Not Available">

- **Problem:** Importing curses fails or keel crashes on launch.
- **Solution:** 
  - On Windows: curses is not available natively.
  - On Linux/macOS: verify Python installation includes the curses module.
  - Reinstall Python via official installers or package managers ensuring ncurses support.

</Accordion>

## Additional Notes

- keel is a terminal-based application making extensive use of keyboard-driven navigation.
- A compatible terminal window size (minimum width ~80 columns, height ~24 rows) is recommended to avoid UI clipping.
