# Troubleshooting Startup & Usage

Help is at hand if you encounter common obstacles when starting or using keel. This guide anticipates typical issues — from permission errors preventing launch to interface display challenges — and provides clear, actionable solutions. If you remain stuck, learn how to report issues to get community support.

---

## 1. Common Startup Issues and Solutions

### 1.1 Permission Denied Errors
When launching keel, you may see errors like `Permission denied` or `Access is denied`. These happen when keel lacks the necessary system rights.

**How to fix:**

- **Run with Elevated Privileges:**
  - On Windows, right-click the executable and choose 'Run as Administrator'.
  - On Linux/macOS, prepend commands with `sudo` in the terminal.

- **Check File and Directory Permissions:** Ensure that your user account has read and execute permissions on keels' installation directory and its dependencies.

- **Verify Security Software:** Some antivirus or firewall solutions block keel's execution. Temporarily disable these or add keel as a trusted application.

### 1.2 Missing Dependencies or Environment Variables
If keel fails to start with errors about missing dependencies or environment variables, it likely means prerequisites are not properly installed or configured.

**Steps:**

1. Review the [System Requirements & Prerequisites](/getting-started/setup-installation/system-requirements) page to confirm all required software is installed.
2. Ensure environment variables are set if your system or keel configuration expects them.
3. Reinstall keel via documented installation paths to automatically handle dependencies.

### 1.3 Display or Interface Not Loading Correctly
If keel launches but its interface is blank, distorted, or unresponsive:

- Confirm your display drivers are up-to-date.
- If connected via remote desktop or virtual machine, check graphical compatibility.
- Clear any cached configuration or temporary files from previous sessions.
- Try restarting keel to reset the UI state.

## 2. Runtime and Usage Errors

### 2.1 Application Freezes or Unexpected Exits
Keel locking up or closing unexpectedly usually indicates resource conflicts or corrupt files.

**Resolution:**

- Restart your device to clear temporary resource locks.
- Reinstall keel to replace corrupted files.
- Check logs located in the installation directory (`logs/keel.log`) to identify specific errors.
- Close other high-resource applications during keel usage.

### 2.2 Incorrect or No Output Produced
If running your first operations produces no results or garbled output:

- Verify proper configuration via the [Installing and Configuring keel](../guides/getting-started/installation) guide.
- Make sure you are connected to the required data sources.
- Validate input files or parameters for correctness and format.

## 3. Logging and Diagnostic Information

Keel maintains detailed logs to assist troubleshooting:

- **Location:** `logs/keel.log` inside the installation directory.
- **Usage:** Open this file with a text editor to review errors or warnings.

If you encounter issues not resolved by this guide, include relevant excerpts from this log file when seeking help.

## 4. How to Report Issues

When problems persist, reporting your issue helps improve keel and ensures community support can assist effectively.

**Steps to report an issue:**

1. Collect information about your environment:
   - Operating system and version
   - Keel version (found via running `keel --version`)
   - Exact error messages or behavior observed
   - Relevant log excerpts (`logs/keel.log`)
2. Visit the keel GitHub issues page: [https://github.com/modelorona/keel/issues](https://github.com/modelorona/keel/issues)
3. Create a new issue, providing the collected information clearly.

<Tip>
Providing detailed and precise information helps maintainers diagnose your problem quickly and reduces resolution time.

## 5. Best Practices to Avoid Startup Issues

- Always follow the installation instructions carefully, particularly for dependencies.
- Run keel with appropriate user permissions.
- Keep your system up-to-date, including graphics drivers.
- Regularly check for keel updates that fix known bugs.
