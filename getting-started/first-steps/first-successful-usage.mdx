# First Successful Usage & Validation

This guide walks you through your first successful use of keel's terminal interface, focusing on process navigation, killing a process, and validating that the application is running correctly. By the end of this walkthrough, you will confidently manage processes using keel and safely exit back to your command line.

---

## 1. Navigating the Process List

Once you launch keel with the required parameters, you will see a list of processes owned by the chosen user (or root by default). The terminal-based interface allows you to:  

- **Use the arrow keys:**
  - `↑` and `↓` to move the highlight up and down through the process list.
  - The highlight clearly indicates the currently selected process.

- **Scroll behavior:**
  - If the list of processes exceeds your terminal view, the interface scrolls automatically to keep the highlighted process visible.

### Practical Tip

When navigating, make sure the process you want to target is highlighted before proceeding to kill it. The highlight is shown by inverse colors or clear visual contrast.

## 2. Killing a Process

With a process highlighted, you can terminate it immediately:

1. Press the `Enter` key.
2. keel will attempt to kill the process by its PID.
3. The killed process will be removed instantly from the list.
4. Remaining processes below the removed one will shift upward to fill the space.

### What to Expect

- If the kill operation succeeds, the process disappears from the display.
- If it fails (e.g., due to permissions or if the process ended independently), an error is logged internally (not shown on screen).

### Important Considerations

- You cannot kill the keel process itself — attempting this will raise an error internally.
- If no more processes remain after killing, keel will exit automatically, returning you safely to your command line.

## 3. Validating keel is Operating Correctly

### Visual Confirmation

- The terminal window displays a clear title bar at the top showing:
  - The current mode (e.g., "Regular" for normal processes or "Connections" if in network mode).
  - The active system username being filtered.
  - Instructions like 'Choose a process to kill and hit enter'.

- The process list updates dynamically on killing and navigation.

- The highlight moves in response to your arrow key presses.

### Functional Confirmation

- Killing a process removes it from the list immediately.
- The program exits cleanly if the list empties, returning your prompt.

You can verify by checking your system's process list separately (e.g., `ps` or `top`) to confirm the targeted process has ended.

## 4. Exiting keel Safely

- At any time, press the `q` key to quit keel and return to your command line.
- Exiting preserves your terminal state and avoids lingering artifacts.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common First-Use Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting First Usage">
<Accordion title="Process List Does Not Appear">
- Confirm you launched keel with the correct parameters for username and mode. Refer to `python3 keel.py -h` for help.
- Ensure the user you specified actually owns running processes.
- If your terminal size is too small, try enlarging the window.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to Kill a Process">
- Verify you have the necessary permissions to kill processes owned by the user.
- Check if the process ended by other means before your kill attempt.
- See if keel’s log file (`output.log`) contains relevant error messages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Highlight Not Moving as Expected">
- Make sure you are using the arrow keys; other keys won’t navigate.
- Confirm your terminal supports ncurses fully.
- Resize your terminal if the highlight disappears outside view.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Next Steps

- Experiment with switching modes and users by restarting keel with different parameters (`-u` for username, `-m` for mode).
- See the [Running keel for the First Time](/getting-started/first-steps/running-keel) guide for detailed launch instructions.
- Visit [Killing Processes from the Interface](/guides/process-management/process-control) to deepen your control techniques.

## Example Command to Run keel for Your First Operation

```bash
python3 keel.py -u root -m regular
```

Replace `root` with your target username and `regular` with `connections` if you want to manage network connections.

By carefully navigating, selecting, and killing processes with keel’s intuitive interface, you ensure swift, controlled management of your system tasks, returning a clean and responsive terminal experience every time.
