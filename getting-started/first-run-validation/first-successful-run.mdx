# First Successful Run

This guide walks you through running **keel** for the very first time, helping you launch the program, understand the ncurses-based terminal UI, and perform your first process kill using the key controls. You'll learn how to interpret the displayed process list, interact with it intuitively, and verify successful operation.

---

## 1. Launching keel for the First Time

Before launching keel, ensure you have installed it and meet all prerequisites outlined in the installation and requirements documentation.

### Step 1: Open your terminal

- Use a Unix-like terminal (Linux, macOS, or compatible shell on Windows).

### Step 2: Run keel with required parameters

keel requires two mandatory parameters:

- `-u / --username` — The username whose processes you want to view and manage. If unsure, use a valid system username or `root`.
- `-m / --mode` — The mode to run the program in. For your first run, use `regular` to see processes.

Example command:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u your_username -m regular
```

Replace `your_username` with an actual username on your system.

<Tip>
If you are unsure of usernames on your system, use the `whoami` command to find your current user.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Confirm program start

Upon running, the terminal window switches to keel's interface showing a list of processes owned by the specified user.

If keel encounters an error, check prerequisites and parameter spelling, and review the troubleshooting guide linked below.

---

## 2. Understanding the User Interface

The keel UI is built with the **ncurses** library. It displays an interactive list of processes.

### What you see at a glance:

- **Title Bar:** Centered at the top, displaying the current mode, user, and instructions (e.g., _Choose a process to kill and hit enter_).
- **Process List:** Each item shows a process as `PID : ProcessName`.
- **Cursor Highlight:** The currently selected process is highlighted. Use arrow keys to move the cursor.

### Navigation Controls:

- **Up/Down Arrow Keys:** Move the highlight up or down through the visible processes.
- **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Supported but do not change functionality significantly in the first run.
- **Enter Key:** Kill the highlighted process.
- **q Key:** Exit the program.

<Tip>
Always ensure you choose the correct process before hitting Enter to kill it. Accidentally killing critical system processes may cause instability.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Running Your First Operation: Killing a Process

Performing your first kill operation validates that keel is working as intended.

### Step 1: Select a process

Use the **arrow keys** to move the highlight to a safe, non-critical process you want to terminate. For first experiments, pick a user-level process that you started manually.

### Step 2: Press Enter

Press the **Enter** key to send a kill command to the selected process. keel uses underlying system calls through Python’s psutil library to terminate the process.

### Step 3: Observe the UI change

- The killed process disappears from the list immediately.
- Remaining processes below shift upwards to fill space.
- The highlight moves to an adjacent process.

<Tip>
If the process cannot be killed (e.g., it's a system process or exited already), keel will silently ignore the failure but log the attempt internally.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Continue or quit

- Continue browsing and killing other processes as needed.
- Press **q** to exit keel cleanly when finished.

## 4. Expected Output and Behavior

- Upon successful program start, the terminal UI displays with:
  - Title indicating mode and user.
  - A scrollable list of user processes shown as `pid : name`.
- Cursor highlights one process, moving up/down with arrow keys.
- Pressing Enter removes (kills) the highlighted process.
- Empty process list or quitting exits the program cleanly.

<Tip>
If you see no processes or the UI fails to appear, verify that the username is valid and that you have permissions to list processes.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common First Run Issues">
<Accordion title="Program fails to start or crashes immediately">
- Ensure you run with Python 3.
- Confirm `psutil` and other dependencies are installed.
- Check your command line syntax and parameters.
- Review log files `output.log` for error details.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Process list is empty or shows limited entries">
- Verify you specified the correct username.
- Some system users have no accessible processes.
- Run as root or use `sudo` if you need elevated permissions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to kill processes">
- Some processes are protected and require root privileges.
- Do not attempt to kill critical system processes.
- Confirm your user has rights to terminate the targeted process.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="UI displays incorrectly or is unusable">
- Ensure your terminal supports ncurses (common in standard terminals).
- Resize the terminal window larger to see more processes.
- Avoid running under unsupported terminals or IDE consoles.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Best Practices for Your First Run

- Start using a non-critical user to avoid accidental system disruption.
- Familiarize yourself with the arrow keys and Enter usage before attempting to kill processes.
- Use the `q` key to exit gracefully.
- Experiment on processes you started yourself (e.g., simple background scripts) to understand behavior safely.

## 7. Next Steps

After successfully running keel and performing your first process kill, proceed to:

- [Troubleshooting Common Issues](/getting-started/first-run-validation/troubleshooting-common-issues) if you encountered problems.
- Explore [Filtering Processes by User](/guides/advanced-usage/filter-by-user) to refine your views.
- Try switching modes to manage network connections by using `-m connections` as mode.
- Deepen your understanding with [Core Concepts & Terminology](/keel-overview/core-concepts-architecture/keel-concepts-terminology).

# Quick Reference: Basic Commands

| Action                  | Key           |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Move Up                 | ↑ (Up arrow)  |
| Move Down               | ↓ (Down arrow)|
| Kill Highlighted Process| Enter         |
| Quit keel               | q             |


---

## Example Session

```bash
$ python3 keel.py -u alice -m regular
```

- Terminal switches to keel interface.
- Title shows: "Choose a process to kill and hit enter, user: alice, mode: Regular"
- List shows:

```plaintext
  12345 : python3
  23456 : vim
  34567 : bash
```

- Use arrow keys to highlight `vim`.
- Press Enter.
- `vim` process disappears instantly.
- Remaining list shifts up.
- Press `q` to exit.
```

---

This completes your first successful run with keel.
