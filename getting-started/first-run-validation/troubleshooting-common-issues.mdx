# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide provides quick, practical solutions to common problems encountered when starting and running **keel**. Whether you face installation hiccups, runtime errors, or interface difficulties, these troubleshooting steps will help you identify and fix issues efficiently â€” so you can focus on managing your processes.

## 1. Python and Terminal Compatibility Issues

### Problem: keel Fails to Start or Shows Errors Related to ncurses or Terminal

- **Cause:** keel relies on Python's `curses` module (ncurses interface) which may have compatibility issues on some platforms or terminal configurations.
- **Solution Steps:**
  1. **Verify Python version:** keel requires Python 3.x.
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
  2. **Confirm availability of `curses` module:**
     Run the Python interactive shell and try:
     ```python
     import curses
     ```
     If this produces an error, curses is not properly installed or supported.
  3. **On Windows:**
     - Python's built-in curses support is limited. Consider running keel in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or using a terminal emulator that supports curses.
     - Alternatively, use a Linux/macOS environment where curses is fully supported.
  4. **Check your terminal settings:**
     - Use terminals that support ANSI escape codes and ncurses (e.g., `xterm`, `gnome-terminal`, `iTerm2`).
     - Avoid minimal consoles that lack proper ncurses support.

<Tip>
If curses import fails on Windows, try installing Windows curses package:
```bash
pip install windows-curses
```
and run keel inside an appropriate terminal.

## 2. Missing or Incorrect Command-line Parameters

### Problem: keel Does Not Start or Shows Usage Errors

- keel requires two mandatory parameters when running the script manually:
  - `-u` or `--username`: Specify the username to filter processes.
  - `-m` or `--mode`: Select the mode - either `regular` for normal processes or `connections` for network connections.

### Correct Usage Example:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u root -m regular
```

### Tips:
- Run help to review usage:
```bash
python3 keel.py -h
```
- Missing parameters will prevent keel from launching.

<Tip>
If you see errors about missing parameters or invalid mode, double-check your command and try the help command for guidance.

## 3. Process Listing Returns Empty or Unexpected Results

### Potential Causes:
- Specifying a username that has no running processes.
- Using incorrect mode or incompatible mode with current system state.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Confirm the username exists on your system and has active processes:
   ```bash
   ps -u your_username
   ```
2. Try running keel with the default user or `root`:
   ```bash
   python3 keel.py -u root -m regular
   ```
3. Switch modes to `connections` to see open network connections:
   ```bash
   python3 keel.py -u root -m connections
   ```

### Additional Notes:
- keel filters processes by the exact username specified.
- The program currently requires valid and active users to display processes meaningfully.

<Tip>
If process list is empty, verify system processes for the user outside keel to isolate if the issue is system-wide or keel-specific.
</Tip>

## 4. Unable to Kill Processes Using Enter Key

### Common Causes:
- Permission issues preventing process termination.
- Attempting to kill system or protected processes.
- keel trying to kill itself (which it prevents).

### How to Diagnose:
- Run keel with sufficient privileges (e.g., use `sudo` if necessary).
- Avoid killing PIDs that belong to system critical services.
- Check the `output.log` file generated by keel for errors related to process killing.

### Example log error snippet:
```
ERROR: Killing PID: 1234 with name: some_process
RuntimeError: I cannot kill myself
```

### If Killing Fails:
- Confirm your user rights for process management.
- Avoid killing processes not owned by your user or root without sudo.

## 5. Program Exits Unexpectedly or Displays Blank Screen

### Possible Reasons:
- The process list becomes empty after killing all visible processes.
- Terminal window is too small to render interface properly.

### Recommendations:
- Resize your terminal to a reasonable size (minimum 80x24).
- Restart keel if it closes unexpectedly, ensuring you specify valid parameters.
- Monitor the logs (`output.log`) for unexpected error messages.

---

## 6. Logs and Debugging

### Where to Find Logs
- keel creates an `output.log` file in the current directory.
- This file records informational messages and errors.

### How to Use Logs
- Review `output.log` to identify errors during startup or when killing processes.
- Use logs to guide further troubleshooting or report issues.
