# Filtering Processes by User

## Overview
This guide shows you how to filter and view system processes by ownership. Whether you want to focus on processes belonging to a specific user or investigate resource use linked to a particular account, this page helps you narrow down the process list quickly and effectively using available UI tools and parameters.

Filtering processes by user ownership provides a clear perspective on system activity relevant to individual users, letting you pinpoint resource hogs, troubleshoot user-specific issues, or audit running tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure keel is running and you have access to the process management interface.
- Basic familiarity with the keel UI layout and navigating to the process view.
- Required permissions to view processes for other users if filtering beyond your own.

## What You Will Achieve
- Learn to switch the active process view based on ownership.
- Use built-in filtering options to isolate processes owned by a chosen user.
- Understand how to apply parameters effectively to refine the process list.

## Estimated Time
About 5 minutes to master filtering and view results.

## Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate — no advanced system admin skills required.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open the Process View Panel
- Navigate to the Processes section in keel’s interface.
- You will see a list/table of all running processes along with key details such as PID, CPU usage, memory usage, and more.

### 2. Locate the Ownership Filter
- Find the filter control labeled “User” or “Owner” above or next to the process list.
- This filter lets you select which user’s processes you want to view.

### 3. Select a User to Filter
- Click on the user dropdown or input field.
- Either select from the list of known user accounts shown or enter the username manually.
- The interface instantly updates to show only processes owned by the selected user.

### 4. Using Command-Line Parameters (Optional)
- If launching keel from the command line, you can apply a filter to only load processes of a specific user.
- Use the parameter (exact syntax may vary, check `--help`):

```bash
keel --user=<username>
```

- This pre-filters process views upon startup.

### 5. Confirm Filter Application
- Verify that the process list exclusively shows processes tagged with the chosen user ownership.
- Check that process counts and resource usage reflect the filtered scope accurately.

### 6. Clear or Change Filter
- To widen the view, clear the filter selection or choose “All Users.”
- Changing the filter again updates the list accordingly without needing to restart keel.

<Tip>
When filtering by user, ensure you have the necessary permissions to view processes owned by others. Restricted access may limit visibility and display incomplete results.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For faster filtering, start typing a username in the filter field and select from the autocomplete suggestions.
</Tip>

## Practical Example
Suppose you want to audit all processes run by user 'alice' to identify any that consume excessive memory.

- Navigate to the process view.
- Enter or select 'alice' in the user filter.
- The list updates instantly, showing only 'alice' owned processes.
- Sort the list by memory usage descending to see top consumers.

This immediate narrowing allows focused troubleshooting or auditing without sifting through the full process list.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Filtered List Shows No Processes">
- Verify the username spelling is correct.
- Confirm that processes for that user are actually running at the time.
- Ensure you have permission to view processes for that user.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Cannot See Processes from Other Users">
- Check your permissions. Some systems restrict access to only your own processes.
- Run keel with elevated privileges if administrative views are needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Filter Dropdown is Empty or Missing">
- Reload the process view to refresh the user list.
- Confirm keel is up to date and there are no UI issues.
- Restart the application if necessary.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Consistently filtering by the user can be combined with other filters (such as process name or status) to create a powerful search to locate any process quickly.
</Tip>
