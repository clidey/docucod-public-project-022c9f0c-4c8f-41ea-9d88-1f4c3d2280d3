# Switching Between Network and System Modes

## Overview

This guide helps you understand and effectively use the **mode** parameter in keel to toggle between viewing two primary types of data:

- **Regular system processes** owned by a user
- **Active network connections** such as TCP and UDP sockets

You will learn when and why to use each mode, how to launch keel with the appropriate mode, and how to interpret what you see in the terminal interface.

---

## What You Will Achieve

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Launch keel to monitor either system processes or network connections
- Understand the context and use cases for each mode
- Navigate and interpret the information displayed in each mode
- Make informed decisions on when to switch modes based on your operational needs

---

## Prerequisites

- keel installed on your system (see [Installation Methods](../getting-started/setup-installation/installation-methods))
- Basic familiarity with terminal usage
- Basic understanding of processes and network connections
- Knowledge of the username whose processes or connections you want to monitor

---

## Understanding keel’s Modes

keel supports two main modes that determine the type of information displayed:

| Mode Name      | Description                                            | Typical Use Cases                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `regular`      | Lists processes owned by the specified user            | Managing or terminating user/system processes     |
| `connections`  | Lists open network connections (TCP, UDP, Unix sockets)| Monitoring, debugging, or closing network connections|

---

## When to Use Each Mode

### Regular Mode
Use this mode when your goal is to:

- View and manage running programs and daemons
- Identify and kill rogue or resource-heavy processes
- Focus on a specific user’s process list to isolate activity

### Connections Mode
Use this mode for:

- Inspecting current network activity and open ports
- Identifying suspicious or unwanted TCP/UDP connections
- Closing (killing) network connections that might indicate malicious activity or unnecessary services

---

## How to Switch Between Modes

### Starting keel with a Mode
To start keel with your desired mode, use the `-m` or `--mode` parameter:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u <username> -m <mode>
```

Replace `<username>` with the user you want to monitor and `<mode>` with either `regular` or `connections`.

Example:

```bash
python3 keel.py -u alice -m regular
python3 keel.py -u bob -m connections
```

### Mode Behavior in the UI
- **Regular Mode** shows processes filtered by the specified user, each line typically displaying `PID : Process Name`.
- **Connections Mode** shifts the display to active network connections filtered by protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).

Note: Currently, switching modes during runtime within the UI is planned but not fully implemented. You must specify the mode at launch.

---

## Interpreting the Output

### Regular Mode Output
You will see a list like:

```
1234 : python3
2345 : nginx
3456 : sshd
```

Where:
- **PID** is the process ID you can target
- **Process Name** helps identify the task or application

Pressing `Enter` on a highlighted process will kill it.

### Connections Mode Output
The program lists sockets and connections, reflecting open network activity such as:

- TCP and UDP connections
- IPv4 and IPv6 sockets
- Unix domain sockets

Titles and details update accordingly to help you choose the connection to close.

Note: This is useful in environments where network connection hygiene is crucial.

---

## Practical Examples

### Launching keel in Regular Mode

```bash
python3 keel.py -u root -m regular
```

This command shows all processes owned by `root`. Navigate the list and press `Enter` to kill any process.

### Launching keel in Connections Mode

```bash
python3 keel.py -u alice -m connections
```

This shows all open network connections, including TCP and UDP, that the specified user has open.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Always verify you have the correct user before killing processes or connections.
- Use `regular` mode for general process management—this covers most system administration tasks.
- Switch to `connections` mode to inspect low-level network activity or to detect suspicious open connections.
- Killing the current process running keel is prevented to avoid accidental self-termination.
- Remember that mode switching within a session is currently not active; restart keel to switch modes.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Mode Selection and Usage">
<Accordion title="I see no processes or connections after launching keel">

- Check if you specified the correct username with `-u`.
- Verify the mode parameter is spelled correctly: `regular` or `connections`.
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to view other users' processes or system/network status.
- If processes are missing, verify system state externally (e.g. using `ps` or `netstat`).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I want to switch modes while keel is running, but it doesn’t work">

- Mode switching on-the-fly is a planned feature but not implemented yet.
- Restart keel with your desired mode instead.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected errors when killing processes or connections">

- Errors can occur if the process no longer exists or you do not have permission.
- Check keel logs for details (see logging configuration).
- Avoid trying to kill the process running keel itself.

</Accordion>
