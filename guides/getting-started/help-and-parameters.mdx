## 1. Understanding the Workflow

### What This Guide Helps You Accomplish
Learn how to use keel's command-line parameters to tailor the tool's behavior to your needs. You'll discover how to invoke help, specify users for process filtering, and switch operation modes — all critical for precise control and efficient execution.

### Prerequisites
- keel installed on your system and accessible via the command line.
- Basic familiarity with terminal or command prompt operations.

### Expected Outcome
After completing this guide, you’ll be able to:
- Access detailed usage help for keel's CLI.
- Use flags to specify user filters.
- Switch keel into different modes for targeted process and network management.

### Time Estimate
Approximately 5 minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate.

## 2. Step-by-Step Guide to Command-Line Parameters

### Accessing Help (-h or --help)
The quickest way to understand all available command-line options is using the help flag.

**Steps:**
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command:

```bash
keel -h
```

or equivalently:

```bash
keel --help
```

**What you should see:**
- A neatly formatted list of all available command-line options, their descriptions, and usage examples.

<Tip>
Always start with the `-h` or `--help` flag to get the latest on keel's capabilities, especially after an update.
</Tip>

### Specifying User Filters with -u or --user
Target specific processes owned by a given user using the user flag.

**Use case:** You want to filter processes belonging to the user "alice".

**Steps:**
1. Run keel with the user parameter:

```bash
keel -u alice
```

2. keel will then display or manage processes specifically owned by alice.

**Expected result:**
- The output or operations reflect only the user-specified processes.

<Tip>
If you omit the user flag, keel operates on all users' processes by default.
</Tip>

### Selecting Operation Modes with -m or --mode
keel supports different modes to control what scope you want to focus on, like process management or network connections.

**Available modes include:**
- `process` — Manage and view processes
- `connections` — View network connections

**Example:** To launch keel in connection viewing mode:

```bash
keel -m connections
```

**Expected result:**
- keel opens in connections mode, displaying network sessions.

<Tip>
Combining flags is supported. For example, to view processes for a specific user:

```bash
keel -m process -u alice
```

This combination filters visible processes to those owned by "alice" and focuses on process management.
</Tip>

### Combining Multiple Parameters
Formulate commands that combine user filters and modes to streamline your workflow.

**Example:** View network connections for user "bob":

```bash
keel -m connections -u bob
```

**Result:**
- Filters displayed data both by mode and user ownership.

## 3. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Quick Help Check
```bash
keel -h
```
Displays all available command-line options and syntax.

### Example 2: Filtering Processes By User "charlie"
```bash
keel -u charlie
```
Shows only processes owned by "charlie".

### Example 3: Viewing Network Connections For All Users
```bash
keel -m connections
```
Launches keel in connections mode without restricting users.

### Example 4: Filtering Network Connections for User "dana"
```bash
keel -m connections -u dana
```
Combines user filter and mode selection.

## 4. Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
- **Help flag shows no output or unknown flag error**: Ensure you run the exact command (`keel -h`), and that keel is properly installed and in your system’s PATH.
- **User filter returns no results:** Confirm the username is correct and that user-owned processes or connections exist.
- **Mode parameter not recognized:** Double-check spelling; supported modes are limited to `process` and `connections`.

### Best Practices
- Always check available options via `-h` after updates.
- Use combined parameters to focus your views and speed up diagnostics.
- When scripting with keel, use parameters explicitly to avoid ambiguity.

### Performance Considerations
Specifying users or modes can reduce output and improve performance, especially on systems with many active processes or connections.

### Alternative Approaches
If you want broader control beyond the command line, explore the GUI or supported management integrations documented elsewhere.
