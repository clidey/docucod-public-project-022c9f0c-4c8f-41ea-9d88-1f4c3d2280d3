# Installing and Configuring keel

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the process of installing keel using Python's package manager `pip`, verifying that your environment meets all necessary prerequisites, and configuring keel for first-time use. By following these instructions, you will prepare your system to run keel effectively and be ready to execute your first commands.

---

## What You Will Accomplish
- Install keel cleanly in your environment
- Verify and resolve any dependency or environment issues
- Configure basic settings and parameters for keel's initial run
- Validate that keel is operational and ready for use

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system
- Access to a terminal or command prompt with internet connectivity
- User permissions to install Python packages (or the ability to use virtual environments)
- Basic familiarity with command-line usage

For detailed system requirements, see the [System Requirements & Prerequisites guide](/getting-started/setup-installation/system-requirements).

---

## Time Estimate
Allow approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the installation and basic configuration steps.

---

## Difficulty Level
Beginner - requires basic knowledge of command-line interface and package installation.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Verify Python Installation">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

You should see Python 3.7 or higher. If not, please install or update Python before proceeding.

<Check>
If your Python version is below 3.7, keel will not install or run correctly.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="2. Install keel with pip">
Run the following command to install keel:

```bash
pip install keel
```

If you have multiple Python versions, you may need to use:

```bash
pip3 install keel
```

or

```bash
python3 -m pip install keel
```

The installation process will download keel and all required dependencies.

<Check>
Verify that there are no errors during installation and that the process completes successfully.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="3. Confirm keel Installation">
Test that keel is installed by checking its version:

```bash
keel --version
```

You should see keel's version number printed.

<Check>
If this returns a command not found error, ensure your Python scripts directory is added to your PATH environment variable.
</Check>

</Step>

<Step title="4. Configure Your Environment for keel">
Typically, keel requires some environment settings depending on your use case:

- Set environment variables if needed (refer to your use scenario)
- Configure any proxy or network settings if your system is behind one

For example, to set proxy temporarily:
```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

<Note>
This step is conditional and may not be necessary for all users. Check with your network administrator if unsure.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="5. Run keel for the First Time">
Execute a simple keel command to verify operational status:

```bash
keel --help
```

This will show available commands and confirm that keel is ready.

<Check>
Seeing the help output confirms that keel is properly installed and configured.
</Check>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Practical Example: Installing keel on Ubuntu 20.04

1. Verify Python:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   # Output: Python 3.8.10
   ```

2. Install keel:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --user keel
   ```

3. Add user local bin to PATH if needed:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
   ```

4. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   keel --version
   # Output: keel 1.2.0
   ```

5. Run help command:

   ```bash
   keel --help
   ```

You should see the usage summary and command list.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="pip Command Not Found">
If running `pip install keel` results in a 'command not found' error:
- Verify pip installation (`python -m ensurepip`)
- Use `python3 -m pip install keel` as an alternative
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Denied Errors">
This happens when you donâ€™t have privileges to install globally:
- Use the `--user` flag with `pip install`
- Alternatively, create and activate a Python virtual environment before installing keel
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="keel Command Not Recognized After Installation">
Ensure your PATH includes the directory where Python installs scripts, e.g., `~/.local/bin` for user installs.
Add it to PATH:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Conflicts or Errors">
- Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies
- Upgrade pip before installing:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Using virtual environments (`python -m venv myenv`) is a best practice that prevents conflicts and keeps your system clean.
</Tip>
